I’ll start by stating I am not against outsourcing. There are definitely situations where it makes sense, especially for resource-constrained organizations who can’t possibly cover every single function by themselves. (On a personal level, hosting this site on SquareSpace is also a form of outsourcing.)
Outsourcing does work for one-off projects where it doesn’t make sense for an organization to hire long-term. So, if you’re working on a one-off data project, it probably makes sense to outsource the work.

It’s a pity that I came across this 6 months too late, as it would have saved me an hour repeating myself thrice on why we can’t use names as a unique key to join across different data sources.
Thankfully my point eventually got across, but to any fellow developer/data scientist/engineer having to explain to stakeholders, hopefully this helps.
And no, you do not want to use email addresses as a unique key either:

The Glicko system is an attempt to encompass this information additionally.
Think about this: If a player has played 3 games: win against a player rated 1500, lose against a player rated 1450 and win against a player rated 1200, how confident are we in the derived rating? On the other hand, if a player has played 50 games, and has won 35 games against opponents rated 2000 and below, drew 5 games against opponents rated 2000-2050 and lost the remaining 10 games versus opponents rated above 2050, we can be fairly certain that his rating is somewhere between 2000-2050.

Rating systems has actually been a part of my life (and probably yours), from early days in chess and then games with matchmaking like CS:GO and Valorant, to now thinking if contract bridge should also have one.
Historical Context Having been around for centuries, chess is a game which people have wasted much time on arguing/debating who is the best player. It’s probably slightly surprising then that the first modern rating systems only appeared around or after the end of World War 2. The first systems (Ingo and Harkness) were quite simple and used the idea of the average rating of opponents with adjustments for the results.

The last election in 2015 introduced the sample count. What is the sample count? From the ELD Website:
From the votes cast at each polling station, a counting assistant picks up a random bundle of 100 ballot papers (in front of the candidates and counting agents present) and counts the number of votes for each candidate (or group of candidates in the case of a GRC).

TL;DR While the sample counts of this year’s GE saw some huge deviations, they are mostly within expectation.
The two hour extension brought about some online groans from friends who didn’t want to stay up late to follow the results. To help alleviate some of this anxiety, I decided to set up a tracking sheet for the sample counts with estimated win probabilities to let people decide if the final count was worth waiting for.
