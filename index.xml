&lt;p>I recall watching the movie adaptation of The Great Gatsby back in 2013. Baz Luhrmann created a visual spectacle, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio as the titular character who has become part of multiple memes. And who can forget Lana Del Rey&amp;rsquo;s haunting vocals for the theme &amp;ldquo;Young and Beautiful&amp;rdquo;? I read the original novel soon after, and was pretty struck by how deep the underlying themes run.
Fast forward to 2025, and it has been exactly a century since F. Scott Fitzgerald published The Great Gatsby. One hundred years later, its themes feel eerily familiar. The excessive wealth, the disillusionment, the relentless pursuit of a dream—all of it maps almost perfectly onto today’s tech-fueled, crypto-charged, influencer-driven landscape. This struck me on a commute home last week and as I thought about it, the main characters do reflect segments of modern day society.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DataScience SG Talk: Data Challenges</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/datachallenges/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/datachallenges/</guid><description>&lt;p>I gave a talk last night at Data Science SG entitled “Trustable Data: Challenges in a National Sports Association”. It gives an outline of what I’ve encountered and done in the past few years for SCBA. &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h88SZ2S25xFc9JAjCdBfWVK-edYJj_btPIN5gI2Za-A/edit">Talk slides can be found here&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why you probably shouldn't outsource data work</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/outsource_data_work/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/outsource_data_work/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was having a conversation with David and the subject of outsourcing came up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll start by stating I am not against outsourcing. There are definitely situations where it makes sense, especially for resource-constrained organizations who can’t possibly cover every single function by themselves. (On a personal level, hosting this site on SquareSpace is also a form of outsourcing.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outsourcing does work for one-off projects where it doesn’t make sense for an organization to hire long-term. So, if you’re working on a one-off data project, it probably makes sense to outsource the work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mandatory Reading on Names</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/names/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/names/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">Yes, we’re talking about actual names&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a pity that I came across this 6 months too late, as it would have saved me an hour repeating myself thrice on why we can’t use names as a unique key to join across different data sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thankfully my point eventually got across, but to any fellow developer/data scientist/engineer having to explain to stakeholders, hopefully this helps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And no, you do not want to use email addresses as a unique key either:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rating Systems (2): Glicko-2</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/rating_2_glicko/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/rating_2_glicko/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="point-vs-interval-estimates">Point vs Interval Estimates&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>One issue with the Elo system as previously raised is how it doesn’t give any information about the uncertainty of the estimate. The Glicko system is an attempt to encompass this information additionally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about this: If a player has played 3 games: win against a player rated 1500, lose against a player rated 1450 and win against a player rated 1200, how confident are we in the derived rating? On the other hand, if a player has played 50 games, and has won 35 games against opponents rated 2000 and below, drew 5 games against opponents rated 2000-2050 and lost the remaining 10 games versus opponents rated above 2050, we can be fairly certain that his rating is somewhere between 2000-2050.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rating Systems (1): Elo and its limitations</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/rating_1_elo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/rating_1_elo/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This is going to be a new series on rating systems, which is a vastly underrated (pun intended) area of statistics and data science. Rating systems has actually been a part of my life (and probably yours), from early days in chess and then games with matchmaking like CS:GO and Valorant, to now thinking if contract bridge should also have one.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="historical-context">Historical Context&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Having been around for centuries, chess is a game which people have wasted much time on arguing/debating who is the best player. It’s probably slightly surprising then that the first modern rating systems only appeared around or after the end of World War 2. The first systems (Ingo and Harkness) were quite simple and used the idea of the average rating of opponents with adjustments for the results.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
