Having been around for centuries, chess is a game which people have wasted much time on arguing/debating who is the best player.

The first systems (Ingo and Harkness) were quite simple and used the idea of the average rating of opponents with adjustments for the results.\nIt is worth noting that the English Chess Federation still has a rating system still in operation (since 1958) with somewhat similar ideas: a player’s grade is his opponent’s grade +- 50 (depending on win, or loss; it’s the opponent’s grade if it’s a draw). The ECF system also caps the difference to 40 points between both players (even if the actual difference is more than 40), and the player’s rating is the average over all the matches during a time period.\nECF System The ECF system, while limited, actually contains some fundamental ideas:\nEqually strong opponents will draw (might not be true for other games), or have an even chance of winning.\nWinning results in gain in rating, losing results in a loss.

Elo suggested scaling the ratings such that a difference of 200 points would give an expected score of 0.75 for the stronger player. The average rating of 1500 was chosen by the US Chess Federation and this is used as the initial rating. Note that no distinction is made between wins and draws in this expected value; a draw is simply half a win.\nThe expected score is simply a logistic function, for example the expected score of Player A and Player B is given below, where R are the respective ratings:\nNote that the two equations are symmetrical.\nThe rating is then updated by multiplying the difference between the actual and expected score by a K factor.\nElo originally set K=10, which is deemed to be too low, i.e. too insensitive/lagging behind actual performance. The FIDE tiers this to three different levels:\nK = 40, for new and young players aged under 18\nK = 20, for players rated below 2400\nK= 10, for players rated above 2400, and at least 30 games played in previous events.\nMathematical Issues The normal distribution is easy to understand, and symmetrical, but in practice the US Chess Federation found the logistic distribution a better fit.\nThe correct value of K, as stated above.\nThe Elo rating is a point estimator, without any indication of uncertainty. This is problematic for players who are new or players returning from a long period of inactivity.\nPractical Issues Players can choose not to play to protect their high rating, which is undesirable for competition.\nPlayers might choose their choice of opponents to minimize risk and maximize rewards\n","wordCount":"657","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-08-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2020-08-14T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shen Ting"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shenting.org/post/rating_1_elo/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shen Ting Ang","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shenting.org/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shenting.org/ accesskey=h title="Shen Ting Ang (Alt + H)">Shen Ting Ang</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
