One issue with the Elo system as previously raised is how it doesn’t give any information about the uncertainty of the estimate. The Glicko system is an attempt to encompass this information additionally.
Think about this: If a player has played 3 games: win against a player rated 1500, lose against a player rated 1450 and win against a player rated 1200, how confident are we in the derived rating? On the other hand, if a player has played 50 games, and has won 35 games against opponents rated 2000 and below, drew 5 games against opponents rated 2000-2050 and lost the remaining 10 games versus opponents rated above 2050, we can be fairly certain that his rating is somewhere between 2000-2050."><meta name=author content="Shen Ting"><link rel=canonical href=https://shenting.org/post/rating_2_glicko/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://shenting.org/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://shenting.org/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://shenting.org/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://shenting.org/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://shenting.org/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://shenting.org/post/rating_2_glicko/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-MlJdn/WNKDGXveldHDdyRP1R4CTHr3FeuDNfhsLPYrq2t0UBkUdK2jyTnXPEK1NQ crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-VQ8d8WVFw0yHhCk5E8I86oOhv48xLpnDZx5T9GogA/Y84DcCKWXDmSDfn13bzFZY crossorigin=anonymous></script><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.2/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js integrity=sha384-+XBljXPPiv+OzfbB3cVmLHf4hdUFHlWNZN5spNQ7rmHTXpd7WvJum6fIACpNNfIR crossorigin=anonymous onload=renderMathInElement(document.body)></script>>

Compute $\\delta$, which is estimated improvement in rating by comparing pre-period rating vs performance rating based only on game outcomes. Determine the new value of volatility. This step requires numerical iterative methods. Update the rating deviation to the new pre-rating period value. Update the rating and RD.
