&lt;p>Given that SCBA re-opened in May 2022 after COVID-19 restrictions were eased, 2023 seems like a good starting point when most people returned to weekly games.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I recall watching the movie adaptation of The Great Gatsby back in 2013. Baz Luhrmann created a visual spectacle, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio as the titular character who has become part of multiple memes. And who can forget Lana Del Rey&amp;rsquo;s haunting vocals for the theme &amp;ldquo;Young and Beautiful&amp;rdquo;? I read the original novel soon after, and was pretty struck by how deep the underlying themes run.
Fast forward to 2025, and it has been exactly a century since F. Scott Fitzgerald published The Great Gatsby. One hundred years later, its themes feel eerily familiar. The excessive wealth, the disillusionment, the relentless pursuit of a dream—all of it maps almost perfectly onto today’s tech-fueled, crypto-charged, influencer-driven landscape. This struck me on a commute home last week and as I thought about it, the main characters do reflect segments of modern day society.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fracture</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/fracture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/fracture/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yep, just one week into the new year of 2025 I fractured my right last finger during football, during the seemingly innocuous act of catching a ball.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having been told for years the stereotype of &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ll know if it is a fracture by the intense pain&amp;rdquo;, I thought it was just a bad sprain, because the pain was aching rather than sharp. There was no swelling, no bruising, so I just went for dinner as usual, and then back home, and that was when the swelling really started.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visualizations at Meetings</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/visualizations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/visualizations/</guid><description>&lt;p>You probably also hate wasting time at meetings. What I don&amp;rsquo;t understand is how some meetings can go on for multiple instances without proper presentation skills - appallingly this is a meeting of senior technical leads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have to be &lt;a href="https://www.bpmn.org/">BPMN&lt;/a>, although that&amp;rsquo;s a good start. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand how half of the meeting revolved around a draft of some standards that was never screen-shared and the meeting spent 30 minutes talking (in circles). The second half of the meeting showed a dashboard (from vendor, not customized), and the presenter was trying to show some trends, but there was no narrative, no custom dashboard or some sort of analysis to demonstrate the hypotheses, and then some proposed scheme of action buried in an email (like, can&amp;rsquo;t you just copy it to a Powerpoint slide and even make it point form?!) that was convoluted enough that it was unclear what was really happening.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You Should not be Using Anaconda</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/anaconda/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/anaconda/</guid><description>&lt;p>Imagine you’re a newcomer to Python and data analytics and some website tells you to use conda.

&amp;ldquo;In lifelong learning, we are expecting the participants to be able to apply what is being taught into their work. Applications to generate value is the key objectives for lifelong learning programmes. Assessment can conducted if it is on the application phase but unnecessary (but good to have) if it is to check if the participants have gained the knowledge needed from the course. In fact, mentoring might be more important as it guides participants, with an unorganized knowledge base as mentioned above, to start organizing the knowledge base and see where the applications of the knowledge are at the same time. However, this is difficult again due to cost issue. Yes, current experienced staff can be the mentor but they are already swarmed with their own work. Hiring external mentor could be a solution but again, opportunity cost for the freelancer can be high if the company only require an hour from the external mentor for guidance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ETH Node Part 3: Block Sync</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/eth_node_3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/eth_node_3/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>I’ll start by stating I am not against outsourcing. There are definitely situations where it makes sense, especially for resource-constrained organizations who can’t possibly cover every single function by themselves. (On a personal level, hosting this site on SquareSpace is also a form of outsourcing.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outsourcing does work for one-off projects where it doesn’t make sense for an organization to hire long-term. So, if you’re working on a one-off data project, it probably makes sense to outsource the work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mandatory Reading on Names</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/names/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/names/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">Yes, we’re talking about actual names&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One issue with the Elo system as previously raised is how it doesn’t give any information about the uncertainty of the estimate. The Glicko system is an attempt to encompass this information additionally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about this: If a player has played 3 games: win against a player rated 1500, lose against a player rated 1450 and win against a player rated 1200, how confident are we in the derived rating? On the other hand, if a player has played 50 games, and has won 35 games against opponents rated 2000 and below, drew 5 games against opponents rated 2000-2050 and lost the remaining 10 games versus opponents rated above 2050, we can be fairly certain that his rating is somewhere between 2000-2050.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RPA Career Talk</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/rpa_career_talk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/rpa_career_talk/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was invited by the Rafflesian Parents Association to give a talk on being a data scientist (as part of a five speaker panel) earlier today. &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yVgou8qDtAnGLuzDmCcoxjOIzAi48JJdgtd5MWqeruk/edit?usp=sharing">Here are the slides.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is going to be a new series on rating systems, which is a vastly underrated (pun intended) area of statistics and data science. Rating systems has actually been a part of my life (and probably yours), from early days in chess and then games with matchmaking like CS:GO and Valorant, to now thinking if contract bridge should also have one.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="historical-context">Historical Context&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Having been around for centuries, chess is a game which people have wasted much time on arguing/debating who is the best player. It’s probably slightly surprising then that the first modern rating systems only appeared around or after the end of World War 2. The first systems (Ingo and Harkness) were quite simple and used the idea of the average rating of opponents with adjustments for the results.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DataScience SG Talk on Sample Count and Podcast</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/podcast_dssg/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/podcast_dssg/</guid><description>&lt;p>A while ago, I wrote about the &lt;a href="sample_count_2">GE2020 sample count&lt;/a>.
