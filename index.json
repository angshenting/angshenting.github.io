Baz Luhrmann created a visual spectacle, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio as the titular character who has become part of multiple memes. And who can forget Lana Del Rey\u0026rsquo;s haunting vocals for the theme \u0026ldquo;Young and Beautiful\u0026rdquo;? I read the original novel soon after, and was pretty struck by how deep the underlying themes run. Fast forward to 2025, and it has been exactly a century since F. Scott Fitzgerald published The Great Gatsby. One hundred years later, its themes feel eerily familiar. The excessive wealth, the disillusionment, the relentless pursuit of a dream—all of it maps almost perfectly onto today’s tech-fueled, crypto-charged, influencer-driven landscape. This struck me on a commute home last week and as I thought about it, the main characters do reflect segments of modern day society.\nTom Buchanan = Trump/Vance/Musk etc. Tom is the gatekeeper of old power. He is loud, aggressive, and entitled—living proof that wealth doesn’t equal class. He dominates conversations and people, and he always lands on his feet. He is brutish and cruel, and infidelity comes naturally to him.\nDaisy Buchanan = Old Money/GOP Daisy is the ultimate prize—beautiful, elusive, and hollow. Gatsby\u0026rsquo;s fixation isn\u0026rsquo;t with her personality, but with the status and security she represents. In 2025, Daisy represents the old political elite, the traditional Republican establishment, the donor class, and old money. She doesn’t take action; she lets others fight for her attention and then quietly retreats to her insulated world. Myrtle Wilson = Poor Populist/MAGA supporters Myrtle wants out. She wants to escape the greyness of her world and step into one of glamor and power. But she’s used, discarded, and ultimately destroyed by the very system she tries to join. She chases after Tom, believing that he will bring her a life of glamour, but only to be run over by Daisy who is driving Gatsby\u0026rsquo;s car.\nGeorge Wilson = Other Poor Blissfully ignorant of the affair his wife (fellow poor) are having with Tom, a man from Old Money, he becomes a pawn in the rivalry between Tom and Gatsby and ends up blaming and killing Gatsby for the death of his wife, before ending his own. Who then does Gatsby represent?\nJay Gatsby = Crypto Bros/Tech Founders Gatsby was a self-made man, though through means which are not exactly deemed as completely honest. His pursuit of Daisy represents his desire for status in society; similarly, the glitzy parties he threw were to chase the image. Does he really love Daisy? Probably not as much as he is in love with the ideal of what Daisy represented. Today\u0026rsquo;s Gatsby is the tech founder or crypto bro chasing legitimacy and glory. He came from nothing, made his millions (or billions) through unconventional means, and now seeks social capital to match his financial one. He is obsessed with status symbols, but beneath the surface lies a gnawing emptiness—a desire to be seen and accepted by a world that may never truly embrace him.\nConclusion Fitzgerald\u0026rsquo;s tale is timeless - humans have been chasing glamour, status and power. However, history does seem to run in cycles - as the world today seems to be on a precipice into a Great Depression-style recession, wars raging/threatening to rage around the world - we seem to have come full circle back into the disenchantment and the end of an era. If we follow the storyline, it\u0026rsquo;s clear who we should not be - Gatsby\u0026rsquo;s tale of dream-chasing ends up in tragedy and he gets blamed for the death of Myrtle even though he is innocent, and almost nobody really mourns his death. If you agree with the above, then perhaps, like me, you\u0026rsquo;ve become Nick and maybe you might be haunted by the death of Gatsby in the future. P.S. Who Jordan Baker represents is left as an open question - I have my own ideas.\n","permalink":"https://shenting.org/post/thegreatgatsby/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"the-death-of-the-american-dream\"\u003eThe Death of the American Dream\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recall watching the movie adaptation of The Great Gatsby back in 2013.

There are definitely situations where it makes sense, especially for resource-constrained organizations who can’t possibly cover every single function by themselves. (On a personal level, hosting this site on SquareSpace is also a form of outsourcing.)\nOutsourcing does work for one-off projects where it doesn’t make sense for an organization to hire long-term. So, if you’re working on a one-off data project, it probably makes sense to outsource the work.\nProblem 1: Most data projects are not one-off, but recurring.\nMost data projects are complex to a certain extent, and require innate understanding of how the data was generated, how the data is processed, and what business questions need to be answered. Is this knowledge easily transferred? How is the organization going to respond to changing needs for the data in the future if the knowledge is not retained within the organization, but exits together with the third party?\nProblem 2: Quality of the work is correlated with ownership/understanding\nSome might find what I’m going to say next controversial: data work is uninteresting without context and/or ownership. It is difficult to trudge through data cleaning, pre-processing, etc. without seeing what the end goal is. That’s not even considering that decisions made on how to process the data are affected by the end goal(s). I can’t speak for my peers, but I find it hard to work on projects where there is no clearly defined question/hypothesis/problem.\nSo is it any surprise that a third-party contractor (who might/might not be underpaid) delivers unoptimized/sub-par implementations after the problem has been poorly/mis-explained?\nSo here’s what I think can be done better: stakeholders need to communicate more if they are outsourcing, and at least give some ownership of the decisions to the people actually dealing with the data. Be upfront about objectives: if there is ambiguity that needs to be resolved with a first cut of the data, say so and be clear about what is needed to resolve the ambiguity. Everyone will be clearer and happier, with less time wasted.\n","permalink":"https://shenting.org/post/outsource_data_work/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was having a conversation with David and the subject of outsourcing came up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll start by stating I am not against outsourcing.

The Glicko system is an attempt to encompass this information additionally.\nThink about this: If a player has played 3 games: win against a player rated 1500, lose against a player rated 1450 and win against a player rated 1200, how confident are we in the derived rating? On the other hand, if a player has played 50 games, and has won 35 games against opponents rated 2000 and below, drew 5 games against opponents rated 2000-2050 and lost the remaining 10 games versus opponents rated above 2050, we can be fairly certain that his rating is somewhere between 2000-2050.\nAnd of course we now also have to take into consideration the opponent’s rating uncertainty too.\nThe Glicko-2 Algorithm The full details can be found in this tutorial by Mark Glickman himself. I’ll run through a summary of the algorithm\nDecide on two system parameters - volatility and constraint constant. Initialize rating to 1500, rating deviation (RD) to 350 and player volatility to 0.06.\nConvert rating and RD to Glicko scale. Normalize rating to 0, and divide both by 173.7178. We will consider a rating period where a player meets a number of opponents with respective ratings and RDs.\nCompute v, which is an estimated variance of the player’s rating based on game outcomes only.\nCompute delta, which is estimated improvement in rating by comparing pre-period rating vs performance rating based only on game outcomes.\nDetermine the new value of volatility. This step requires numerical iterative methods.\nUpdate the rating deviation to the new pre-rating period value .\nUpdate the rating and RD.\nConvert back to original rating scale (i.e. normalised to 1500)\nIf a player does not play during a period, then only run step 6, increasing the RD according to the volatility constant.\nAdvantages Measure of volatility/uncertainty\nInactivity is “penalized” with increased uncertainty\nDoesn’t rely on constant K - avoids issues of K being set wrongly\nDisadvantages Computationally complicated\nNot all players can understand two numbers instead of one for rating.\nGlicko-2 is very popular - it is used on both chess.com and lichess.com. It is also the base for rating systems in DotA, CS:GO and other esports titles.\n","permalink":"https://shenting.org/post/rating_2_glicko/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"point-vs-interval-estimates\"\u003ePoint vs Interval Estimates\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne issue with the Elo system as previously raised is how it doesn’t give any information about the uncertainty of the estimate.

Rating systems has actually been a part of my life (and probably yours), from early days in chess and then games with matchmaking like CS:GO and Valorant, to now thinking if contract bridge should also have one.\nHistorical Context Having been around for centuries, chess is a game which people have wasted much time on arguing/debating who is the best player. It’s probably slightly surprising then that the first modern rating systems only appeared around or after the end of World War 2. The first systems (Ingo and Harkness) were quite simple and used the idea of the average rating of opponents with adjustments for the results.\nIt is worth noting that the English Chess Federation still has a rating system still in operation (since 1958) with somewhat similar ideas: a player’s grade is his opponent’s grade +- 50 (depending on win, or loss; it’s the opponent’s grade if it’s a draw). The ECF system also caps the difference to 40 points between both players (even if the actual difference is more than 40), and the player’s rating is the average over all the matches during a time period.\nECF System The ECF system, while limited, actually contains some fundamental ideas:\nEqually strong opponents will draw (might not be true for other games), or have an even chance of winning.\nWinning results in gain in rating, losing results in a loss. The outcomes are binary.\nSome form of capping is needed to prevent huge changes in rating, or even worse, higher rated players losing rating even after a win.\nAveraging over a time period.\nOne big criticism is how the ECF rating system is a “lagging” indicator, especially for junior players who improve faster than the rating system can catch up.\nElo System The rating system takes its name after it’s inventor, Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American professor of physics who was also a chess player.\nExpected Score The main idea of the rating system is that of the expected score, which is the sum of the probability of winning plus half the probability of drawing (in chess, a score of 1 is given for a win and 0.5 for a draw). Elo suggested scaling the ratings such that a difference of 200 points would give an expected score of 0.75 for the stronger player. The average rating of 1500 was chosen by the US Chess Federation and this is used as the initial rating. Note that no distinction is made between wins and draws in this expected value; a draw is simply half a win.\nThe expected score is simply a logistic function, for example the expected score of Player A and Player B is given below, where R are the respective ratings:\nNote that the two equations are symmetrical.\nThe rating is then updated by multiplying the difference between the actual and expected score by a K factor.\nElo originally set K=10, which is deemed to be too low, i.e. too insensitive/lagging behind actual performance. The FIDE tiers this to three different levels:\nK = 40, for new and young players aged under 18\nK = 20, for players rated below 2400\nK= 10, for players rated above 2400, and at least 30 games played in previous events.\nMathematical Issues The normal distribution is easy to understand, and symmetrical, but in practice the US Chess Federation found the logistic distribution a better fit.\nThe correct value of K, as stated above.\nThe Elo rating is a point estimator, without any indication of uncertainty. This is problematic for players who are new or players returning from a long period of inactivity.\nPractical Issues Players can choose not to play to protect their high rating, which is undesirable for competition.\nPlayers might choose their choice of opponents to minimize risk and maximize rewards\n","permalink":"https://shenting.org/post/rating_1_elo/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is going to be a new series on rating systems, which is a vastly underrated (pun intended) area of statistics and data science.
