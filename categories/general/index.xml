&lt;p>I recall watching the movie adaptation of The Great Gatsby back in 2013. Baz Luhrmann created a visual spectacle, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio as the titular character who has become part of multiple memes. And who can forget Lana Del Rey&amp;rsquo;s haunting vocals for the theme &amp;ldquo;Young and Beautiful&amp;rdquo;? I read the original novel soon after, and was pretty struck by how deep the underlying themes run.
Fast forward to 2025, and it has been exactly a century since F. Scott Fitzgerald published The Great Gatsby. One hundred years later, its themes feel eerily familiar. The excessive wealth, the disillusionment, the relentless pursuit of a dream—all of it maps almost perfectly onto today’s tech-fueled, crypto-charged, influencer-driven landscape. This struck me on a commute home last week and as I thought about it, the main characters do reflect segments of modern day society.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why you probably shouldn't outsource data work</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/outsource_data_work/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/outsource_data_work/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was having a conversation with David and the subject of outsourcing came up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ll start by stating I am not against outsourcing. There are definitely situations where it makes sense, especially for resource-constrained organizations who can’t possibly cover every single function by themselves. (On a personal level, hosting this site on SquareSpace is also a form of outsourcing.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outsourcing does work for one-off projects where it doesn’t make sense for an organization to hire long-term. So, if you’re working on a one-off data project, it probably makes sense to outsource the work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mandatory Reading on Names</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/names/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/names/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">Yes, we’re talking about actual names&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a pity that I came across this 6 months too late, as it would have saved me an hour repeating myself thrice on why we can’t use names as a unique key to join across different data sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thankfully my point eventually got across, but to any fellow developer/data scientist/engineer having to explain to stakeholders, hopefully this helps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And no, you do not want to use email addresses as a unique key either:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
