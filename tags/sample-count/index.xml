Do also check out the second talk as reinforcement learning is always an interesting subject - props to Siddarth for giving that quick summary of RL!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The last election in 2015 introduced the sample count. What is the sample count? &lt;a href="https://www.eld.gov.sg/mediarelease/SampleCount_Generic.pdf">From the ELD Website&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the votes cast at each polling station, a counting assistant picks up a random bundle of 100 ballot papers (in front of the candidates and counting agents present) and counts the number of votes for each candidate (or group of candidates in the case of a GRC).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Much Should You Trust the Sample Count?</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/sample_count_2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/sample_count_2/</guid><description>&lt;p>(Note: This was originally posted on Facebook)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TL;DR While the sample counts of this year’s GE saw some huge deviations, they are mostly within expectation.&lt;/p>
