&lt;p>Was not totally happy as I didn’t realise that Google Sheets speaker notes covers the actual slides when I was screen sharing over zoom. Also, this is the first time I’ve actually given a career talk, and realised it was 15 years ago when I was sitting in the audience on the other side. Time flies!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DataScience SG Talk on Sample Count and Podcast</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/podcast_dssg/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/podcast_dssg/</guid><description>&lt;p>A while ago, I wrote about the &lt;a href="sample_count_2">GE2020 sample count&lt;/a>.

Do also check out the second talk as reinforcement learning is always an interesting subject - props to Siddarth for giving that quick summary of RL!&lt;/p>
