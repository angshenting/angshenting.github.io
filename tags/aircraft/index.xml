&lt;p>The biggest takeaway is the &amp;ldquo;P.I.O.S.E.E&amp;rdquo; decision making model mentioned about 37 minutes in, as what the pilots could have done:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Problem&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Information&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Options&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Execute&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Evaluate&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Aviation incidents usually have pretty good learning points, as a lot of high-stakes decisions have to made under high stress, and hence a lot of useful frameworks and concepts come from the industry. (Maybe also partially my bias from serving in RSAF!) In this case, the pilots failed to appreciate early enough that the tailstrike might have caused structural issues and accepted instructions to climb higher and higher. Thankfully their company maintenance advised them to abort the flight instead of flying for hours across the US back to Florida!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
