There was no swelling, no bruising, so I just went for dinner as usual, and then back home, and that was when the swelling really started.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MRT Challenge</title><link>https://shenting.org/post/mrt_challenge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shenting.org/post/mrt_challenge/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since the new house is relatively settled now, we were inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/kmsbl4/challenge_accepted_122_mrt_stations_rta/">woonie’s post&lt;/a> to try &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ku4nla/for_science_122_mrt_stations_6_lrt_stations/">a different route.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
