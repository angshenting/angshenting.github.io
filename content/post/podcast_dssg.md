A while ago, I wrote about the [GE2020 sample count](sample_count_2). Together with Yong Sheng,[] we gave a talk about this at DataScience SG last night (Youtube link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9-zax0mMrw). Do also check out the second talk as reinforcement learning is always an interesting subject - props to Siddarth for giving that quick summary of RL!

[Also, Symbolic Connection’s episode featuring me is now live!](https://anchor.fm/symbolic-connection/episodes/015--Ang-Shen-Ting--Data-Scientist-with-INSEAD-ejep1e/a-a1pvsb)

Thanks to Koo Ping Shung for organizing both of the above.

With these two out of the way, hopefully I have the time to get back to rating systems…
