In the past 8 months, Iâ€™ve probably worked on close to 10 different projects. While half of these consists of not more than a few Jupyter notebooks, the others consist of intermediate data and different notebooks for preprocessing and modelling.

Cookiecutter seems to be a good solution and framework: https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/

Refactoring those projects will take some effort, but I believe it will be well worth the time to do so.
