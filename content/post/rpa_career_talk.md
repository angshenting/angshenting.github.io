I was invited by the Rafflesian Parents Association to give a talk on being a data scientist (as part of a five speaker panel) earlier today. [Here are the slides.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yVgou8qDtAnGLuzDmCcoxjOIzAi48JJdgtd5MWqeruk/edit?usp=sharing)

Was not totally happy as I didn’t realise that Google Sheets speaker notes covers the actual slides when I was screen sharing over zoom. Also, this is the first time I’ve actually given a career talk, and realised it was 15 years ago when I was sitting in the audience on the other side. Time flies!
