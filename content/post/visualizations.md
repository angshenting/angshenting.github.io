You probably also hate wasting time at meetings. What I don't understand is how some meetings can go on for multiple instances without proper presentation skills - appallingly this is a meeting of senior technical leads. 

Look, it doesn't even have to be [BPMN](https://www.bpmn.org/), although that's a good start. I don't understand how half of the meeting revolved around a draft of some standards that was never screen-shared and the meeting spent 30 minutes talking (in circles). The second half of the meeting showed a dashboard (from vendor, not customized), and the presenter was trying to show some trends, but there was no narrative, no custom dashboard or some sort of analysis to demonstrate the hypotheses, and then some proposed scheme of action buried in an email (like, can't you just copy it to a Powerpoint slide and even make it point form?!) that was convoluted enough that it was unclear what was really happening.

Of course, it could just well be that the presenters don't really know what they are doing...
